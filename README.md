<h1># RPG---Java</h1>
<h2>Character creator using Java</h2><br>
Alternate versions can be seen in <a href="https://github.com/howlcipher/rpg">Go</a> and <a href="https://github.com/howlcipher/RPG---Python">Python</a>.
  
  
<strong>This is a Pen and Paper style character creation.  Currently this is a work in progress.</strong>

<h2>Specifics:</h2>
Typically the word class is used to describe the characters function such as "warrior" or "wizard".  However, in Java I felt using the word job would be easier to see within the code.

<h2>Jobs include:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>WARRIOR</li>
  <li>WIZARD</li>
  <li>ROGUE</li>
  <li>CLERIC</li>
<li>User Created</li>
</ol>
